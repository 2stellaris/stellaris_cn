NEW anomaly.187.desc:0 "After countless failed attempts, our researchers have finally managed to upload the remaining alien neural scans to a population of robots. So far the ancient aliens have displayed no signs of having a consciousness beyond that of a basic robot, leading the public to question whether the results were faked.\n\nThe engineering department is exalted, however, and suggest that we integrate the aliens into society."

CHANGE anomaly.187.desc:0 "在无数次尝试失败之后，我们的研究人员终于成功将剩余的外星人神经扫描结果上传到了一群机器人之中。目前为止这些古代外星人还没有展现出任何超越基础型机器人层面的自我感知与智能，已有公众开始质疑结果是否伪造了。\n\n但工程部门对此事依旧十分兴奋，并建议我们将这些外星人吸收入我们的社会。"
NEW anomaly.1194.desc:0 "Following the recent advancements in the field of robotics, the scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName] is confident that we can produce synthetic bodies sophisticated enough to support a higher neurological consciousness. We could upload the neural patterns that were recovered from the alien vault discovered some time ago into robots, and bring the aliens back to life."
