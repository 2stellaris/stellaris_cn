NEW EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying a quarter million colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Oort Cloud - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again, and the destabilized wormhole vanished.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships survived the passage and established a flourishing colony on a lush alien moon. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."

CN  EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "21世纪末，联合国赞助的尤利西斯计划见证了地球低轨道上六艘巨型方舟舰船的建造工作。船上配备了强大而又不稳定的虫洞发生器，并且每艘船上都搭载了25万名志在开拓遥远星系的殖民者。但他们一去不复返，对亚空间虫洞的研究也被很快叫停。\n\n但地球人不知道的是，其中一艘方舟成功到达了一个草木青葱的外星球并成功了扎下了根。征服了这个蛮荒星球的先驱们非常热衷于实现人类与生俱来的使命 - 不惜一切代价征服整个银河系。"
